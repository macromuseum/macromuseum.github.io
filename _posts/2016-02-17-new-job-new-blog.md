 New job, new blog
 
 I started my new job as a Researcher at the Natural History Museum London in August 2015. Prior to this I'd been working at Trinity College Dublin for three and a half years. During my time there we developed a very successful blog, [EcoEvo@TCD](http://ecoevoblog.com), that I really enjoyed writing for. Not only was it a lot of fun, it also formed a great outlet for writing about projects in progress and papers our group had published. On moving to the Museum I hoped to continue this by setting up a blog for the Vertebrates Division here. For various reasons this hasn't worked out so instead I'm starting a new personal blog. Hopefully there will be contributions from some of my colleagues/friends (friend-leagues!) and past members of my lab. As soon as I have a group again I'm also hoping they will join in too!
 
 It's important to note that this is *not* an official Natural History Museum blog. The views expressed in the posts and comments on this blog do not reflect the Natural History Museum or any other third party mentioned or referred to on the blog. They should be understood as the personal opinions of the authors only.
 
 I doubt I'll update this regularly, but I hope some of the content is interesting/useful/amusing to someone, even if that someone is just me!
