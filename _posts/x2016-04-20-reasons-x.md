Today we got an email telling us that the alcohol supply to the building has been restored. Phew! No-one wants to see us sober up!

Getting around the Museum and avoiding the crowds usually means using the less attractive basement routes. These are confusing. I once took a wrong turn and came out in the middle of the dinosaur exhibit and couldn't find my way out. Animatronic dinosaurs are surprisingly creepy when it's dark and you're lost. Also most directions involve reference to Giraffe Corner. Where there are no giraffes.

Yesterday I genuinely used the following excuse to avoid a meeting: "I've taken all the bits of whale out of the cupboards and need to put them back in ASAP"
