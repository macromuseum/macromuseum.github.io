One of our projects in the cetacean collection involves taking bone and baleen samples to extract stable isotope data from (see this post). Often you'll see in the literature that "samples were taken" but you don't always get a full sense of how this works. Hence a post about a computational biologist, a powertool, and some 90 year old whale dust!

One of the more frustrating aspects of academic life are the weird peaks and troughs of activity on projects. Things often move glacially slowly through the planning stages, then suddenly there is a mad rush at the last minute when things come together. This is why, after months of slow planning, I ended up rushing to a DIY store an hour before it closed to buy a Dremel. 

Full disclosure - I am a mostly computational biologist. My life is spent in front of a computer except for trips to the collections and occasional field work (I go to the field once every 2-3 years, remember why I don't do fieldwork, and don't go into the field for another 2-3 years). It should not come as a surprise therefore, that I was woefully unprepared for our [link] first trip to the cetacean collections to collection baleen samples. I had planned the transport, food, meeting times etc. but had not even considered "equipment". Thus the email a few days before we were due to visit the collections suggesting I bring my lab coat (I haven't worn a labcoat to do science for over ten years, apart from when teaching undergraduate students R in a lab as we didn't have another room big enough to hold over a 100 people), safety goggles and a Dremel with cutting blade attachments, was quite a surprise!

I managed to dig up the safety gear from the stores, but had to go out and buy a Dremel. I'm a fan of DIY stores so this was quite an exciting prospect, and fairly straightforward apart from the rush. I was less amused when I attempted carrying two reference books, a Dremel, four labcoats, four dust masks, four sets of safety googles, 50 sterile tubes, a laptop etc. across London in rush hour. When parts of the kit, including surgical scissors and gloves, slid out on the tube I'm pretty sure some of the tourists thought I was preparing an elaborate murder! Well at least it gave me a bit more space, and it all got to the right place in the end.

The funniest part of this whole experience is when I actually ended up using the Dremel to slice off some baleen for our project. Due to difficulties on our first day in the collections, I had to return alone to sort out all the samples to send to Southampton.
