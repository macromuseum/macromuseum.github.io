TL;DR: transitions are hard, being prepared is your best plan. 

We've got a few group members who have either recently transitioned career stages or are about to, so it seemed a good time to talk about career transitions. To help I posted this on Twitter, assuming I'd get a handful of replies, but instead loads of people sent really helpful suggestions (thanks all!). After an excellent discussion about this in our group meeting, here are the summary take homes we came up with. Note that I've summarised and paraphrased many points; for the full discussion see the thread on Twitter. Massive thanks to everyone that contributed, and apologies if I missed any of your tips :)

Below I first cover the common themes across all transitions, then specific notes about each one, followed by the overall take home message/advice.

## Common themes

There were a couple of things people brought up for multiple transitions...

1. Increase in emails. 
2. Increase in admin.
3. Increase in meetings.
4. Increase in competing demands for your time and energy. 
4. Decrease in time to do science/explore ideas.

So if you're a student feeling like you have a lot of emails/admin/meetings I have some bad news for you; it is only going to get worse! But don't panic, it does get easier to deal with things as you gain experience. If you're very overwhelmed it's worth taking time to come up with a system to deal with this early. You might need to modify it at each career stage, but having some system is better than none.

## Masters to PhD

### Surprises/challenges
- lack of structure
- lack of feedback
- more administrative tasks
- more competing demands on time

### Good stuff
- you can work normal hours
- fewer deadlines
- cool to focus on one project for three years
- you get paid to do research

### Tips
- PhD is a marathon and MSc/MRes is a sprint. It is so easy to burn out if you continue working the same hours you’ll have done in your MSc/MRes. Try to treat your PhD like a 9-5 job where possible.
- PhD gives much more space to explore and think. Take advantage of this. If you want to learn something or improve, the first few years of your PhD are the best time to do this.
- You might not feel like you have much spare time as a PhD student. If there are things you want to achieve, try scheduling time each week to do them and stick to it. Otherwise it's easy to just work on your thesis.

## PhD to postdoc
### Surprises/challenges

- more administrative tasks
- more competing demands on time. Often need to deal with PhD projects and new projects at the same time. Need to learn how to prioritise.
- lose your identity as a student
- suddenly expected to know everything and do things without help, but at the same time not always trusted to do things you did during your PhD
- less freedom. Now an employee so working for someone and following their agenda rather than your own.
- central conflict of postdoccing is between you and your goals, and the goals of your boss. Requires a lot of communication, negotiation and careful prioritisation. 
- stress of uncertainty

### Good stuff

- more money!
- taken seriously/given more responsibility

### Tips
- Learn how to prioritise your work. You might need to negotiate this with your boss. My boss agreed I should spend one day a week on my own work, and 4 days on his work. This meant I could get old projects finished but still make progress on what I was employed to do.
- be very careful about agreeing to do extra stuff. Balance long term gain career stuff with small CV additions.
- ask about moving expenses
- ask if salary can be increased
- Get a mentor who has no link to your project for independent advice.

## Postdoc to independent research fellow

### Surprises/challenges

- failure to live up to potential was a constant worry
- people will not help because they assume you know what you're doing
- people will give you extra things to do in a selfish way
- need to deal with admin often in a new institution.
- need to be very careful about agreeing to do extra stuff. Balance long term gain career stuff with small CV additions.

### Good stuff
### Tips

- Going from post-doc to fellow can easily take a year, even if you are very successful. Start applying early! 
- be very careful about agreeing to do extra stuff. Balance long term gain career stuff with small CV additions.
- Try and deal with as much admin as you can before starting the fellowship. Ideally move to the city a few weeks in advance to do moving related admin
- Get a mentor who has no link to your project for independent advice.

## Academia to non-academia

### Surprises/challenges
- Pay might not be great (in museums and sci comm for example). Especially if coming from a PhD as student discounts/tax breaks will no longer apply.
- Need to have experience which might be unpaid volunteering
- Contracts are often temporary
- Pressure to work more/better to impress people to get a permanent contract

### Good stuff
- the disappearance of guilt/feeling of needing to work "just one more hour" to get stuff done. 
- normal working hours, taking holidays etc.
- increased interactions with your colleagues and team working (compared to isolation of PhD work)
- less pressure on you as an individual, more emphasis on the team.

### Tips




## Postoc/fellow to Faculty

This attracted the most comments. I suspect due to the genuine shock most of us felt as new faculty desperately trying to keep our heads above water! Most people admitted they expected a change, but were surprised by just how extreme that change was.

### Surprises/challenges
- How extreme the change of the job was: in my case from about 90%/10% for research/everything else to 10%/90%.
- The salary often isn't much better (and can be worse) than a postdoc salary. Especially true for fellows (MSCA fellows in Europe for example are very well paid).
- ADMIN, ADMIN and more ADMIN!
- MEETINGS, MEETINGS and more MEETINGS!
- So many more emails it's impossible to keep up. 
- Amount of work is overwhelming. Systems that worked well in my earlier career stages just couldn't keep up
- Requires a crazy refocusing to develop courses (if teaching) and a ton of administrative things
- Teaching is fine, but the admin around organising teaching, exams etc is a killer
- Marking/grading is excessive
- Emotional stress of not keeping great people/ideas due to lack of funding 
- lots of competing demands/opportunities
- People management
- Massive reduction in time for thinking/science/coding etc.
- Have to transition to having others do the research for you, which can be difficult.
- ⬆️importance of networking (impact, policy, funders)


### Good stuff

- job security
- more money (but not always)
- ability to start a group and work with amazing ECRs
- mutual benefit of working with productive people who can play nice
- get invited to give seminars in fun places more often
- security means you have space to do some soul searching. What makes me happy? What are my priorities? How do I maintain my mental/physical health? i.e. stuff you tend to put off when stressing about the next job

### Tips
- Have data for papers, or think of papers without collecting data so you can keep publishing in the first few years while setting up new projects.
- need to plan, prioritise and strategise.
- ask about moving expenses
- ask if salary can be increased
- Get a mentor who has no link to your project for independent advice.
- need to carefully plan and strategise and prioritise to avoid just doing urgent tasks and not making progress with things you care about or need for promotion.
- be aware that setting up a new lab and creating new teaching materials takes a lot of time. Don't expect do do much, if any, research for a couple of years! 

- Postdocs (often) have long periods of unscheduled time in which to get research work done. Faculty time is often shredded into small chunks. Protecting larger chunks of free time and hoarding busywork to usefully use "time confetti" is a key skill to develop.

## Transitions are hard!

The tl;dr from all of this is that transitions are hard, and no-one talks about them much, thus making them harder and scarier. The main solution people had was to talk about them more, and to be prepared. 

At all stages, take time to think carefully about what you want to do next, and what do you need to do to get there. Talk to others who already have made that transition, and/or to your supervisor/boss, and/or to a mentor, and/or even ask for advice on Twitter. Then try and find ways you can move towards your goals. Schedule time in your calendar to do this. 

Also remember that preparation often needs to be done quite far in advance. If you need to add stuff to your CV to make a transition, you'll need to do that far enough in advance for it to be feasible. If you want to apply for fellowships or other grants, remember these take time, not only to write but also from submission to actually starting the fellowship, assuming you're successful.

Finally, remember this is your life, and no two career paths are identical. What worked for your boss 20 years ago might not be the right choice today. Get advice from as many people as possible. Then choose what is right for you. And don't be afraid to do what you need to in order to be happy.
