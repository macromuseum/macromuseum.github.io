title: Value for money?
---

Recently Andrew Jackson over on [EcoEvo@TCD](http://www.ecoevoblog.com/2015/10/19/money-walks-and-talks-in-academia/) was talking about the problems that those of us with low budget science sometimes face within our institutions and (ironically) with funding bodies. Specifically the problem is that increasingly large grants are required to gain tenure etc., but for those of us with cheap research getting large grants is difficult and unnecessary. All of this got me thinking about exactly what the value for money of my research group actually was.

###Income 2012-2015###
January 1st 2012 seems like a good place to start as this was when I took up my first Faculty position at Trinity College Dublin. In the last 4 years I have secured only one grant of 100,000 euro. I also was lucky enough to have access to €21,000 of start up funds, €3000 of travel funds, and €31,000 of funds for my students' equipment and travel costs. I am ignoring my wages and student stipends for now. In total this comes to €155,000.

I haven't actually spent all this money. I still have the final year of Marie Curie money to spend (€25,000) and left around the same amount in Trinity College Dublin when I moved institutions. So my income is more like €100,000 for four years.

OUTPUTS
The measurable outputs of this are papers, presentations and posters. We have written 12 papers (only counting papers we starting working on after January 2012 but including papers in review/in press). Between myself, my two students and one intern we have given 6 posters, 11 presentations at international conferences (3 invited) and 13 invited seminars. 

Less tangibly, this money paid for my students and I to attend 13 conferences, collect data from five different international museums, run a two week pilot study in Madagascar, visit collaborators, run outreach events, support postgraduate training activities, pay open access fees for all papers led by someone in the group, attend training courses etc. It also paid for six computers, two sets of digital calipers, two SLR cameras with macro lenses, binoculars for fieldwork, and a 3D scanner for data collection, plus a load of books. 

VALUE FOR MONEY
If we count each of the 42 tangible outputs as equal, each cost €2381, it's €2777 each if we ignore posters, and if we only count papers that's €8333 a paper. That still seems pretty high to me and doesn't include salary costs or stipends.
